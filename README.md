# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm passionate about computer vision and love diving into math problems to explore new challenges and solutions. My journey revolves around integrating machine learning with real-world applications, and Iâ€™m always looking for creative ways to push the boundaries of technology.

### With strong proficiency in Python and JavaScript, I enjoy building efficient, scalable solutions. Whether it's writing clean code, developing algorithms, or experimenting with new frameworks, I'm always excited to learn and grow.

### Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me for collaborations!
